## Intro:

Followed this video for this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgGkF4k9c7A
Express and MongoDB as backend and React as frontend.

## following libraries are used:

- cors (allows us to communicate through api that we create)
- express (https://github.com/expressjs/express)
- mongoose (https://mongoosejs.com/docs/)
- nodemon (as soon as we save changes - it will re-start server automatically)
- react
- axios (will allow you to create HTTP request and send it from frontend to backend)
- MongoDB Compass (allows you to read and see data)
- MongoDB Atlas (allows you to host and see MongoDB database)

## To start this project:

npm install in server and client both folders
npm run devStart (to start server - backend)
npm start (to start client - frontend)
